### ASIAIR Modkit Installation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to install the ASIAIR Modkit to ensure that it is properly located on the `/boot` partition to protect it from OS changes made by the vendor.

#### **Prerequisites**
- A computer with Linux, macOS, or Windows.
- Access to the ASIAIR device via SMB file sharing or SSH.
- Basic familiarity with file transfers and command-line operations (optional for advanced setup).

### **Installation Workflow**
Depending on your setup, choose one of the following methods to install the ASIAIR Modkit:

#### **Method 1: Using SMB File Sharing (Recommended for Windows/macOS Users)**
Many ASIAIR devices expose their `/boot/Images` partition as a publicly writable SMB share, often labeled **EMMC Images** or a similar name. If you do not have SSH access or prefer a simpler approach, follow these steps:

For a home network / local lan context, the Asiair and Seestar will announce themselves to the local network, so network shares can be accessed with a shortcut of `\\asiair` or `\\seestar`. This may not work in a remote context, such as over a VPN, so you'll need to know the IP address of the device.

1. **Access the ASIAIR Boot Partition via SMB:**
   - On **Windows**, open `File Explorer`, enter `\\<ASIAIR-IP-ADDRESS>` in the address bar, and locate `EMMC Images` or `Images`.
   - On **macOS**, open `Finder`, press `Cmd + K`, enter `smb://<ASIAIR-IP-ADDRESS>`, and connect as a guest.

2. **Download the Release Zip:**
   - Visit the [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/billndotnet/asiair-modkit/releases) and download the latest `.zip` file.

3. **Extract the Files to the ASIAIR Boot Partition:**
   - Copy and paste the extracted folder into `/boot/Images/asiair-modkit`.

4. **Verify File Placement:**
   - Open the folder in the SMB share and confirm that all Modkit files are present.

#### **Method 2: Using SSH and Git (For Advanced Users)**
If you prefer command-line access, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/billndotnet/asiair-modkit.git
   ```

2. **Create the Target Directory on the ASIAIR Device**
   ```bash
   ssh root@<ASIAIR-IP-ADDRESS>
   mkdir -p /boot/Images/asiair-modkit
   ```

3. **Transfer the Modkit Files**
   ```bash
   scp -r * root@<ASIAIR-IP-ADDRESS>:/boot/Images/asiair-modkit
   ```

4. **Verify File Placement**
   ```bash
   ls -la /boot/Images/asiair-modkit
   ```

5. **Grant Execution Permissions**
   ```bash
   chmod -R +x /boot/Images/asiair-modkit
   ```

---

### **Running the Modkit**

Once installed, navigate to the Modkit directory on the ASIAIR device:
```bash
cd /boot/Images/asiair-modkit
```

From here, follow any specific instructions provided within the Modkit repository for executing relevant scripts or modifications.

---

### **Keeping the Modkit Updated**
If using the SMB method, simply re-download and overwrite the existing files in `/boot/Images/asiair-modkit` with the latest release.

For Git users:
```bash
cd asiair-modkit
git pull
scp -r * root@<ASIAIR-IP-ADDRESS>:/boot/Images/asiair-modkit
```

---

### **Important Notes**
- Storing the Modkit on the `/boot/Images` partition ensures it survives OS updates performed by the vendor, as the vendor should not be deleting files from the user accessible partition. 
- Modifying your ASIAIR device can cause problems. Proceed with caution. ZWO does not currently, to my knowledge, offer a method of restoring the base operating system for Plus and Mini models.
- Always back up critical files before making significant changes to the system.

If you encounter any issues, refer to the troubleshooting section in the repository README or open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/billndotnet/asiair-modkit/issues).
